#' Allow a user to use == and \%in\% on an lfactor for both the label and the
#' level
#'
#' Similar to a factor, the user defines levels and labels when 
#' creating an \code{lfactor}. This is especially useful when
#' labels are long, and users know the levels well.
#'
#' See \code{\link{lfactor}} for examples.
